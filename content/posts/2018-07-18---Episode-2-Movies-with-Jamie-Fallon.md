Jamie Fallon knows a lot about movies. Well, she oughta, being that she's Head of Creative at the Tribeca Film Festival. This week, she joins Abe and Burt to talk about all types of movies, even the ones with talking. It doesn't stop there. The boys have some movie ideas of their own to pitch. If Jamie really does work at Tribeca, we should be seeing Abe and Burt at the festival next year.
